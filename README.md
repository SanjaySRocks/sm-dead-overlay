# Dead Overlay

A sourcemod plugin which shows banner overlay to dead players

You can show your banner or image file anywhere on screen of your choice of resolution and size

Its a better alternative of existing command `sv_server_graphic1`

I have used https://github.com/shanapu/overlays.inc for showing overlay

Follow these steps to create your overlay banner
